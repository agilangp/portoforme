                commitment, and sheer f.., ohhkaaay.. I think those words is a
                bit too much for me. Just trying to emphasize that I really love
                and have passion for what I do. Things that keeping me up at
                night wishing that I could do better are software development,
                graphic design, and drawing. Currently, software development is
                rapidly growing skill of mine which categorized me as a
                full-stack software developer.
